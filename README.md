# TLO Chatbot

## Overview

The TLO Chatbot is an interactive web application developed for TLO, designed to provide users with detailed, fact-based responses in a conversational format. It seamlessly integrates front-end technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—with a Python backend that leverages the Google Gemini API. A distinctive feature of the chatbot is its welcome screen, which displays an image that gracefully disappears upon the user's first interaction.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Offers a clean and user-friendly design that facilitates seamless conversations.
- **Dynamic Welcome Screen:** Displays a centered welcome image (`TLO_welcome.png`) upon initial page load, which automatically disappears after the user sends their first message.
- **Responsive Communication:** Provides detailed, fact-based responses to user inquiries.
- **Loading Indicator:** Utilizes a visual cue to inform users when the chatbot is processing a response from the Gemini API.
- **Extended Functionality:** Supports file uploads and voice recording, with ongoing enhancements to fully implement these features.
- **Enhanced Code Display:** Features code block styling accompanied by a copy-to-clipboard functionality for user convenience.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-End:** Python
- **API Integration:** Google Gemini API

## Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/88448844/TLO_CHATBOT.git
   ```


2. **Set Up Python Environment:**
   - Navigate to the repository directory:
     ```bash
     cd TLO_CHATBOT
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On **Windows:**
       ```bash
       .\venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On **macOS/Linux:**
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     *Ensure that the `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary dependencies, such as `google-generativeai`.*
3. **Prepare Front-End Assets:**
   - Ensure that the `TLO_welcome.png` image file is located in the same directory as `index.html`.

## Usage

1. **Start the Python Backend:**
   - Activate the virtual environment (if not already active).
   - Run the Python server:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
2. **Open the Chatbot Interface:**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. **Interact with the Chatbot:**
   - Upon loading, the welcome image appears.
   - Enter your message in the input field and click the send button (paper plane icon).
   - The welcome image will disappear, and the conversation will commence.
   - The chatbot's responses will follow, with a loading indicator displayed during processing.

## Customization

- **Welcome Image:** To change the welcome image, replace `TLO_welcome.png` with your preferred image, ensuring it has the same filename and resides in the correct directory. Adjust its size by modifying the CSS rules for `#welcome-screen` and `#welcome-image` in the `<style>` section of `index.html`.
- **Styling:** Customize the chatbot's appearance by editing the CSS variables and styles within the `<style>` section of `index.html`.
- **Functionality:** Modify the chatbot's behavior by altering the core logic found in the `<script>` section of `index.html` and the `server.py` file.
